If any of the following risks actually occur, the business, results of operations or financial condition of the Issuer could be materially adversely affected.\\n\\nSecuritisation Law\\n\\nThe Securitisation Law was enacted in the Republic of Italy in April 1999. As at the date of this Prospectus, only limited interpretation of the application of the Securitisation Law has been issued by any Italian court or governmental or regulatory authority, except for limited regulations issued by the Bank of Italy concerning, inter alia, the accounting treatment of securitisation transactions by special purpose companies incorporated under the Securitisation Law, such as the Issuer, and the duties of the companies which carry out collection and recovery activities in the context of a securitisation transaction.\\n\\nConsequently, it is possible that such or different authorities may issue further regulations relating to the Securitisation Law or the interpretation thereof, the impact of which cannot be predicted by the Issuer, or any other party to the Transaction Documents as at the date of this Prospectus.\\n\\nOn 24 December 2013, Italian Law Decree no. 145 of 23 December 2013 (Interventi urgenti di avvio del piano Destinazione Italia, per il contenimento delle tariffe elettriche e del gas, per la riduzione dei premi RC auto, per linternazionalizzazione, lo sviluppo e la digitalizzazione delle imprese, nonch misure per la realizzazione di opere pubbliche ed EXPO 2015) (the Decree 145), converted with amendments into Law No. 9 of 21 February 2014, came into force introducing certain amendments to the Securitisation Law. In particular, Decree 145 has provided, inter alia, that:', metadata={'source': 'data/input/prospectus.pdf'}), Document(page_content='the special purpose vehicles incorporated under the Securitisation Law may open segregated accounts with the servicers for the deposit of the collections received from the debtors and the other amounts paid to the special purpose vehicles under the securitisation transactions; the sums deposited into such accounts will be segregated from the assets of the servicers with which the accounts are held, as well as from those of any other person holding deposits with the servicers, and will be available only to satisfy the obligations of the special purpose vehicles in respect of the noteholders and the other creditors in relation to the securitisation transactions. In the event that the servicers become subject to any proceeding under Title IV of the Consolidated Banking Act or any insolvency proceeding or restructuring agreement, the sums deposited into such accounts will remain outside the servicers estate and will not be subject to suspension of payments;\\n\\n\\n\\nthe servicers or the sub servicers may open accounts with banks for the deposit of the collections received from the debtors; any action from the creditors of the servicers on the sums deposited into such accounts will be prohibited (save for the amounts in excess of those pertaining to the special purpose vehicles). In the event that the servicers become subject to any insolvency proceeding or restructuring agreement, the sums deposited on such accounts, for an amount equal to the amounts pertaining to the special purpose vehicles, will remain outside the servicers estate and will not be subject to suspension of payments;\\n\\n\\n\\nfrom the date of publication of the notice of transfer of the receivables in the Official Gazette, the debtors will not be entitled to set off any claim arisen after such date with the amounts due to the special purpose vehicle in relation to the receivables; and\\n\\n6\\n\\npayments made by debtors in relation to receivables in the framework of a securitisation under the Securitisation Law will not be subject to declaration of ineffectiveness pursuant to article 65 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law.\\n\\nIn addition, Law Decree No. 91 of 24 June 2014 (Disposizioni urgenti per il settore agricolo, la tutela ambientale e lefficientamento energetico delledilizia scolastica e universitaria, il rilancio e lo sviluppo delle imprese, il contenimento dei costi gravanti sulle tariffe elettriche, nonch per la definizione immediata di adempimenti derivanti dalla normativa europea) converted with amendments into Law No. 116 of 11 August 2014 introduced certain amendments to the Securitisation Law for the purpose of improving the Securitisation Law by granting additional legal benefits to the entities involved in securitisation transactions in Italy and by better clarifying certain provisions of the Securitisation Law.\\n\\nRisks connected with the Issuers ability to meet its obligations under the Notes', metadata={'source': 'data/input/prospectus.pdf'}), Document(page_content='Risks connected with the Issuers ability to meet its obligations under the Notes\\n\\nThe Notes constitute direct, secured limited recourse obligations solely of the Issuer. In particular, the Notes will not be obligations or responsibilities of, or guaranteed by, any of the Representative of the Noteholders, the Quotaholder, the Cash Manager, the Computation Agent, the Principal Paying Agent, the Listing Agent, the Transaction Bank, the Corporate Services Provider, the Servicers, the Master Servicer and the Originators. None of the aforementioned parties, other than the Issuer, accepts any liability whatsoever in respect of any failure by the Issuer to make any payment of any amount due on the Notes.\\n\\nThe Issuer does not, and will not as of the Issue Date, have any significant assets other than the Portfolios and the other Issuers Rights. In addition, for so long as any amounts remain outstanding in respect of the Notes, the Issuer has undertaken to carry out further securitisation transactions only in accordance with Condition 3 (Covenants). The assets relating to each further securitisation transaction carried out by the Issuer in accordance with Condition 3 (Covenants) will, by operation of law and of the Transaction Documents, be segregated for all purposes from the Portfolios and the Issuers rights under the Transaction Documents (see also the paragraph headed Further Securitisations below).\\n\\nThere is no assurance that, over the life of the Notes or at the redemption date of the Notes (whether on the Final Maturity Date, upon redemption by acceleration of maturity following the service of a Trigger Notice, or otherwise), there will be sufficient funds to enable the Issuer to pay interest on the Notes, or to repay the Notes in full.\\n\\nIf there are not sufficient funds available to the Issuer to pay in full all principal and interest and any other amounts due in respect of the Notes, then the Noteholders will have no further claims against the Issuer in respect of any such unpaid amounts. After the Notes have become due and payable following the delivery of a Trigger Notice, the only remedy available to the Noteholders and the Other Issuer Creditors is the exercise by the Representative of Noteholders of the Issuers rights under the Transaction Documents. In this respect, the net proceeds of the realisation of the Issuers rights under the Transaction Documents may be insufficient to pay all amounts due to the Noteholders after making payments to other creditors of the Issuer ranking prior thereto. In the event of a shortfall in such proceeds, the Issuer will not be obliged to pay, and the other assets of the Issuer will not be available for payment of, such shortfall, all claims in respect of which shall be extinguished.\\n\\nThe ability of the Issuer to meet its obligations in respect of the Notes will be dependent upon the Issuers receipt of collections made on its behalf by the Servicers, the recovery made on its behalf by the Master Servicer with respect to the Portfolios and any other amounts received by the Issuer pursuant to the provisions of the other Transaction Documents to which it is a party.\\n\\nIn this regard it shall be considered that each of the Noteholders, the Representative of the Noteholders and the Other Issuer Creditors under the Intercreditor Agreement undertake not to (directly or by means\\n\\n7', metadata={'source': 'data/input/prospectus.pdf'}), Document(page_content='7\\n\\nof any other person acting on behalf of them) institute against the Issuer, or join in any institution against the Issuer of, any bankruptcy, winding up, re organisation, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceedings or other proceedings under any applicable bankruptcy or similar law in connection with any obligations relating to the Notes or the other documents relating to the issue of the Notes for two years and one day after the repayment in full or cancellation of all the Notes.\\n\\nLiquidity and credit risk\\n\\nThe Issuer is subject to the risk of delay arising between the scheduled payment dates and the date of receipt of payments due from the Borrowers. The Issuer is also subject to the risk of, among other things, default in payments by the Borrowers and the failure by the Servicers and the Master Servicer to collect or recover (as the case may be) sufficient funds in respect of the Portfolios to enable the Issuer to discharge all amounts payable under the Notes. With respect to the Rated Notes, these risks are mitigated by the liquidity and credit support provided by the establishment of the Liquidity Reserve, the excess spread and the credit support provided through the subordination of the Junior Notes.\\n\\nHowever, in each case, there can be no assurance that the levels of collections and the recoveries received with respect to the Portfolios, together with the credit support and the liquidity support provided by respectively the subordination of the Junior Notes and the Liquidity Reserve (in the case of the interest of the Rated Notes) will be adequate to ensure punctual and full receipt of amounts due under the Notes.\\n\\nCounterparty risk\\n\\nThe ability of the Issuer to make payments in respect of the Notes will depend to a significant extent upon the due performance by the Originators, the Master Servicer and the Servicers, the other parties to the Transaction Documents and the Insurance Companies of their respective obligations under the Transaction Documents to which they are parties or the Insurance Policies. Whereas all the above  mentioned counterparties may be affected by the general economic conditions which, in turn, will affect their ability to provide the services, the timely payment of amounts due on the Notes will depend, in particular, on the ability of the Servicers to service the Portfolios and on the ability of the Master Servicer to recover the amounts relating to Defaulted Claims (if any).\\n\\nThe performance of such parties and the Insurance Companies of their respective obligations respectively under the relevant Transaction Documents or the Insurance Policies is dependent on the solvency of each relevant party.', metadata={'source': 'data/input/prospectus.pdf'}), Document(page_content='The Issuers ability to make payments in respect of the Notes may depend to an extent upon the Originators performance under the Transaction Documents. In particular, in the event that any of the Originators becomes subject to insolvency or similar proceedings, it would no longer be in a position to meet its obligations under the Transaction Documents including inter alia the relevant obligations (i) as Master Servicer or Servicer (as the case may be), (ii) to indemnify the Issuer under the Warranty and Indemnity Agreement and the Notes Subscription Agreement and (iii) the relevant obligations to make the payments due to the Issuer in order to adjust the Claims purchase price (i.e. to take into account the additional payment or the reimbursement to be made for any such Claim) in the event that, following the entering into of the Transfer Agreements, it appears that one or more Claims listed under the schedule A thereto do not meet the Criteria as at the Valuation Date (or the specific date referred to in the relevant criterion) and therefore do not fall within the scope of the assignment under the Transfer Agreements. In addition, any payment made by such Originator as an indemnity under the Warranty and Indemnity Agreement and the Notes Subscription Agreement, or as an indemnity for the renegotiation of the Claims under the Servicing Agreement or as repurchase price of the Claims, may\\n\\n8\\n\\nbe subject to the ordinary claw back regime under Italian law (other than the shorter claw back period that applies to the transfer of the Claims to the Issuer).\\n\\nIn addition to the above, it is not certain that, if BPB or CRO becomes insolvent or the appointment of either of them as Servicer under the Servicing Agreement is otherwise terminated, a suitable alternative servicer could be found to service the relevant Portfolio. If such an alternative servicer were to be found it is not certain whether it would service the relevant Portfolio on the same terms as those provided for in the Servicing Agreement. However, it is to be noted that according to the relevant Transfer Agreement, each Originator has provided the Issuer in respect of the relevant Portfolio with a (i) a solvency certificate in the form attached to the relevant Transfer Agreement and (ii) a certificate of the competent companies register, stating that no insolvency proceeding is pending against such Originator.\\n\\nFurthermore, in some circumstances (including following the delivery of a Trigger Notice), the Issuer could attempt to sell the Portfolios to third parties. However, there is no assurance that a purchaser could be found nor that the net proceeds of the sale of the Portfolios would be sufficient to pay in full all amounts due to the Noteholders.\\n\\nMore generally, the inability of any of the above mentioned third parties to provide their services to the Issuer may ultimately affect the Issuers ability to make payments on the Notes.\\n\\nEligible investments\\n\\nFunds on deposit in the Accounts may be invested in Eligible Investments by the Cash Manager (as directed by the Master Servicer) through the Investment Account. The investments must have appropriate ratings depending on the term of the investment and the term of the investment instrument, as provided by the Eligible Investment definition. However, it may be that, irrespective of any such rating, such investments will be irrecoverable due to the insolvency of the debtor under the investment.', metadata={'source': 'data/input/prospectus.pdf'}), Document(page_content='None of the Servicers and/or any other party will be responsible for any loss or shortfall deriving therefrom.\\n\\nHowever such risk is mitigated by the provisions that in case of downgrade of an Eligible Institution below the rating allowed with respect to DBRS or Moodys, as the case may be, the Issuer shall in case of Eligible Investments being deposits, transfer within 30 days the deposits to another account opened with an Eligible Institution in Italy, England or Wales (and in case such account will be held in England or Wales, subject to the Issuer having created thereon a valid, binding and enforceable security and obtained a legal opinion in this respect in accordance with applicable law and jurisdiction).\\n\\nClaims of unsecured creditors of the Issuer\\n\\nBy operation of the Securitisation Law and of the Transaction Documents, the right, title and interest of the Issuer in and to the Portfolios and the other Issuers Rights will be segregated from all other assets of the Issuer (including, for the avoidance of doubt, from assets relating to other securitisations carried out by the Issuer pursuant to the Securitisation Law) and amounts deriving therefrom (for so long as such amounts are credited to one of the Issuers accounts under the Transaction and not commingled with other sums) will be available on a winding up of the Issuer (whether in the context of an insolvency proceeding or otherwise) only to satisfy the Issuers obligations to the Noteholders and to pay other costs of the Securitisation. Amounts deriving from the Portfolios and the other Issuers Rights (for so long as such amounts are credited to one of the Issuers accounts under the Transaction and not commingled with other sums) will not be available to any other creditors of the Issuer. However, under\\n\\n9\\n\\nItalian law, any other creditor of the Issuer would be able to commence insolvency or winding up proceedings against the Issuer in respect of any unpaid debt.\\n\\nIn order to ensure such segregation: (i) the Issuer is obliged pursuant to the Bank of Italy regulations to open and to keep separate accounts in relation to each securitisation transaction; and (ii) the Servicers shall be able to identify at any time, pursuant to the Bank of Italy regulations, specific funds and transactions relating to each securitisation and shall keep appropriate information and accounting systems to this purpose; (iii) the parties to the Transaction have undertaken not to credit to the Accounts amounts other than those set out in Cash Administration and Agency Agreement.\\n\\nMoreover, the provisions of article 3 of the Securitisation Law concerning the patrimonio separato are not likely to apply in circumstances where the cash flow referred to above is commingled with the assets of a party other than the Issuer (such as, for example, the Servicers   see in this respect the section entitled Liquidity and credit risk above). Thus, if any such party becomes insolvent, any such cash  flow held by it could not be included in the patrimonio separato.\\n\\nIn addition, no guarantee can be given on the fact that the parties to the Transaction will comply with the law and contractual provisions which have been inserted in the relevant Transaction Documents in order to ensure the segregation of assets.

Pursuant to article 3 of the Securitisation Law, the assets relating to each individual securitisation transaction will, by operation of law, be segregated from all other assets of the company that purchases the receivables. On a winding up of such company, such assets will only be available to holders of notes issued to finance the acquisition of the relevant receivables and to certain creditors claiming payment of debts incurred by such company in connection with the securitisation of the relevant assets.\\n\\nThe implementation by the Issuer of any such further securitisation is subject to the conditions specified under Condition 3.10 (Covenants   Further Securitisation).\\n\\n10\\n\\nLimited recourse nature of the Notes\\n\\nThe Notes will be limited recourse obligations solely of the Issuer.

Such risk is usually mitigated through the transfer of the collections held by the servicers, within a very limited period of time, into bank accounts opened in the name of the issuers with Eligible Institutions.

Consequently, it was unlikely that the SFI website would have been available to reporting entities by 1 January 2017 and that ESMA would be in a position to publish the technical instructions by 1 July 2016. On such basis, ESMA did not expect to be in a position to receive the information related to SFI from reporting entities from 1 January 2017. In the press release ESMA clarified that it expected that new securitisation legislation, which was in the legislative process, would provide clarity on the future obligation regarding reporting on SFIs.', metadata={'source': 'data/input/prospectus.pdf'}), Document(page_content='According to a regulation recently issued by the European Parliament and the European Council, laying down a general framework for securitisation and creating a specific framework for simple, transparent and standardised securitisation (the STS Regulation) the above mentioned article 8(b) of the CRA Regulation has been repealed.\\n\\n18\\n\\nOn 1 January 2019, Regulation (EU) 2017/2402 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2017 (together with any relevant regulatory technical standards and/or any relevant implementing measures or official guidance in relation thereto, in each case, as amended varied or substituted from time to time, the Securitisation Regulation) which lays down a general framework for securitisation and creates a specific framework for simple, transparent and standard securitisation entered into force.

This commenced the formal two year process (although this has subsequently been extended twice) of negotiations regarding the terms of the withdrawal and the framework of the future relationship between the UK and the EU (the Article 50 Withdrawal Agreement).

However, it remains uncertain whether the Article 50 Withdrawal Agreement, or any alternative agreement, will be finalised and ratified by the UK and EU ahead of the deadline. If the deadline of 31 October 2019 is not met, unless the negotiation period is further extended or the Article 50 notification revoked, the Treaty on the European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU will cease to apply to the UK and the UK will lose access to the EU single market. Whilst continuing to discuss the Article 50 Withdrawal Agreement and political declaration, the UK Government has commenced preparations for a hard Brexit (or a no deal Brexit) to minimise the risks for firms and businesses associated with an exit with no transitional period. This has included publishing draft secondary legislation under powers provided in the EU (Withdrawal) Act 2018 to ensure that there is a functioning statute book after any exit without a transitional period.\\n\\nDue to the on going political uncertainty as regards the terms of the UKs withdrawal from the EU and the structure of the future relationship, the precise impact on the business of the Issuer is difficult to\\n\\n19\\n\\ndetermine.

The Portfolios have, as at the date of the approval of the Prospectus, characteristics that show the capacity to produce funds to service payments due on the Notes. However, there can be no guarantee that the Borrowers will not default under the Loans and that they will continue to perform their relevant payment obligations. Borrowers may default on their obligations due under the Loans for a variety of reasons. Various factors influence delinquency rates, prepayment rates, repossession frequency and the ultimate payment of interest and principal, such as changes in the national or international economic climate, regional economic conditions, changes in tax laws, interest rates, inflation, the availability of financing, yields on alternative investments, political developments and government policies. Certain factors (including general economic conditions and other similar factors) may lead to an increase in default by and bankruptcies of the Borrowers and could ultimately have an adverse impact on their ability to repay the Loans. Overall economic recession and a further decline in the national and international economic outlook, or a general deterioration of economic conditions in any industry in which the Borrowers operate may negatively impact the solvency of the borrowers and therefore the recovery of mortgage loans.\\n\\nThe recovery of amounts due in relation to non performing loans will be subject to effectiveness of enforcement proceedings in respect of the Portfolios which, in the Republic of Italy, can take a considerable time depending on the type of action required and where such action is taken and upon several other factors.\\n\\nMutui fondiari\\n\\nThe Portfolios comprise certain Loans that are mutui fondiari, in relation to which special enforcement and foreclosure provisions apply. Pursuant to article 40, paragraph 2 of the Consolidated Banking Act, a mortgage lender is entitled to terminate a loan agreement and accelerate the mortgage loan (diritto di risoluzione contrattuale) if the debtor has delayed an instalment payment at least seven times whether consecutively or otherwise. For this purpose, a payment is considered delayed if it is made between 30 and 180 days after the payment due date. Accordingly, the commencement of enforcement proceedings in relation to mutui fondiari may take longer than usual.\\n\\nRisk of losses associated with declining property values\\n\\nThe security for the Notes consists of, inter alia, the Issuers interest in the Loans and the relevant collateral guarantees.

Such review aims at introducing reform of insolvency legislation that is better suited to the current economic situation and consistent with the indications received from the European legislator.\\n\\nThe Delegated Legislation is inspired by the principle of an early detection and resolution of corporate insolvency also through flexible and modern reorganisation methods; in such a context, the declaration of bankruptcy (now defined as judicial liquidation, liquidazione giudiziale) is considered as a last resort alternative in absence of other options that can guarantee continuation of the corporate activity. Please note that it is likely that in the coming months this Delegated Legislation may be amended to correct certain aspects that, according to the current wording of the law, are not clear or in any case need improvements.\\n\\nIn accordance with the above principles, the Delegated Legislation introduces the new preemptive and assisted reorganisation procedures further complementing in this way the regulation of the currently existing pre insolvency proceedings (i.e. restructuring proceedings under article 182bis and certified plans under article 67(3)(d) of the Bankruptcy law) and insolvency proceedings (scheme of arrangements with creditors and bankruptcy). The reform of the so   called extraordinary administration proceedings has not been included in the scope of the Delegated Legislation and will likely require an ad hoc intervention.\\n\\n24\\n\\nStakeholders have long faced a difficulty in coordinating the restructuring proceedings of companies belonging to the same group. The legislation currently in force does not provide for the opening of a single restructuring proceedings with regard to multiple affiliated companies, this resulting in an inefficient process also compounded by the fact that different territorial courts have competence for each different single proceedings. Therefore in order to address such issues, the Delegated Legislation provides for the introduction of a new joint proceedings for group insolvencies. More specifically, the Delegated Legislation introduces:\\n\\na)\\n\\na definition of corporate group by reference to the criteria of direction and coordination referred to in articles 2497 et seq. and 2545 septies of the Italian civil code; such criteria are presumed as met in case within the group there are controlling and controlled entities pursuant to article 2359 of Italian civil code;\\n\\nb)\", metadata={'source': 'data/input/prospectus.pdf'}), Document(page_content='b)\\n\\njoined single proceedings: the possibility for companies belonging to the same group to file a single application for approval of a debt restructuring plan agreement under article 182bis of the Bankruptcy Law or admission to an out of court arrangement with creditors or judicial liquidation or a court settlement agreement before a single court of law (as determined in accordance with the European principle of center of main interests of the debtor); hence the subsequent appointment of only one single (i) judge and (ii) court appointed receiver with regard to a scheme of arrangement or judicial dissolution and payment of a single fund of expenses in the case of a scheme of arrangement with creditors.\\n\\nc)\\n\\nseparate resolution meetings with regard to schemes of arrangement with creditors: in case of a scheme of arrangement, separate resolutions on the proposal by the creditors of each company and the exclusion of infra group creditors from voting in order to mitigate any distortion effects;\\n\\nd)\\n\\nsubordination of infra group debt in situations described by article 2467 of the Italian civil code (i.e. the company has resorted to additional debt in situations where a capital contribution was instead required), with the exception of infra group loans granted in the context of schemes of arrangement or a debt restructuring agreement under article 182bis of Bankruptcy Law;\\n\\ne)\\n\\nextension of the receivers powers with regard to solvent companies: in the event of a judicial liquidation, the power of the receiver, inter alia, to report irregularities in the management of the solvent companies of the group (e.g. article 2409 of the Italian civil code) and to request their bankruptcy in the event of insolvency.\\n\\nPreemptive Proceedings\\n\\nAs mentioned above, the Italian legislator has worked on the assumption (shared by the European regulator and business philosophy) that the successful recovery of a business largely depends on early detection of crisis situations, which instead the entrepreneur often tends to deny.\\n\\nIn order to facilitate a prompt detection of the crisis, on one hand the Delegated Legislation requires the entrepreneur to have in place an adequate corporate structure which can detect a crisis situation in a timely manner, and on the other hand, has introduced preemptive proceedings and crisis assisted reorganization proceedings (the Preemptive Proceedings) to induce the distressed company to address the crisis early on.\\n\\nSuch regulation however does not apply to listed and large companies on the assumption that, due to their dimension, such entities have adequate resources to detect the crisis and address it on an early stage.\\n\\nThe Preemptive Proceedings are based on a resolution of the crisis agreed with creditors and implemented through the assistance of a body of experts activated by the debtor or indirectly by public creditors or corporate auditing entities. The Preemptive Proceedings   which are to be conducted in a confidential manner   provide for the following:\\n\\na)\\n\\nthe debtor who acknowledges a state of crisis files an application with a body set up in the relevant Chamber of Commerce (the Committee) in order to receive assistance in finding an agreed solution to the crisis with the creditors within a maximum period of 6 months;\\n\\nb)', metadata={'source': 'data/input/prospectus.pdf'}), Document(page_content=\"b)\\n\\nqualified public creditors (including the Tax Agency and Social Security Agency) must (i) inform the relevant debtor that its debt exposure has exceeded a significant amount and (ii) inform the supervisory entities and the Committee, in case the debtor has not addressed the problem\\n\\n25\\n\\nwithin a 3 months period (such as by starting the Preemptive Proceedings, or by carrying out a scheme of arrangement or a debt restructuring);\\n\\nc)\\n\\nin the event of the debtor's inaction, the above mentioned public creditors must report to the supervisory entities and the Committee ongoing defaults of a significant amount;\\n\\nd)\\n\\nin addition, in all cases of inaction on the part of the debtor (and regardless of reporting by qualified public creditors) the corporate auditing bodies, auditors and auditing firms are obliged to immediately notify the administrative entities of any well grounded indications of a crisis situation (the chartered accountant representative body shall prepare indexes to be used to establish when a company is to be considered in crisis) and, in the event of inadequate or lacking response by these, the Committee;\\n\\ne)\\n\\nduring the proceedings, the debtor may apply to the relevant Court for the adoption of protective measures to enable the same to enter into negotiations protected from any action of creditors (in respect of such protective measures, the debtor may postpone the reduction of any losses pursuant to the provisions of article 182 sexies the Bankruptcy Law with reference to the debt restructuring agreements and the schemes of arrangements;\\n\\nf)\\n\\nif within six months from the start of the proceeding the relevant debtor does not adopt appropriate measures to overcome the crisis (including entering into agreements with creditors or filing a debt restructuring agreement in court or apply for an in court composition with creditors), the Committee reports the state of insolvency, (if any) to the Public Prosecutor (who will be able to file for bankruptcy where the conditions are met).\\n\\nFinally, in order to encourage the use of Preemptive Proceedings, the Law provides for a system of incentives and penalties:\\n\\n\\n\\nIncentives:\\n\\n1.\\n\\nfor debtors who have taken action to overcome the crisis within 6 months from the first sign of its occurrence (using the assistance of the Committee or the proceedings for the approval of a debt restructuring agreement under article 182bis of the Bankruptcy Law, or a scheme of arrangement with creditors): (a) there will no penalty for bankruptcy by fund distraction crimes and other bankruptcy offences when they have caused minor damage;

Such choice will make it difficult to carry out typical investment operations involving the purchase of receivables from distressed/insolvent companies in order to then control and approve the relevant scheme of arrangement proposal;\\n\\nd)\\n\\nthe definition of a scheme of arrangement in continuity and deferment of privileged claims: it is clarified that a scheme of arrangement in continuity refers to both mixed schemes of arrangements (continuity plus disposal of non instrumental assets); furthermore, payment of privileged creditors may be postponed up to two years, provided that they are granted voting rights;\\n\\ne) super senior loans authorised by the court: super senior are confirmed during the proceedings\\n\\nand by way of execution of the plan; super senior loans are no longer permitted;\\n\\nf) mandatory classation of creditors: creditors must necessarily be divided into classes if there are, among others, creditors assisted by third party guarantees (and in other cases where there are homogeneous legal positions and economic interests that are to be identified by the Government);\\n\\ng) electronic vote: the meeting of creditors is replaced by an electronic voting procedure;\\n\\nh) provisional administration: in the event of obstruction by the debtor, the Court may entrust the implementation of the scheme of arrangement to a provisional administrator entrusted with the powers usually belonging to the creditors' meeting (this power is currently only provided if a competing proposal is accepted);\\n\\ni)\\n\\ntermination of the scheme arrangement by the receiver: the receiver has the power to require, following the request from a creditor, that the scheme of arrangement be terminated, inter alia, for non performance (currently, such right is recognised only to creditors);\\n\\n27\\n\\nj) mergers/demergers/transformations: in the case of extraordinary transactions (mergers, demergers and transformations), (i) the creditors' opposition is exercised in the context of the Schemes of Arrangement; (ii) the effects of extraordinary transactions are irreversible once executed; (iii) the right of withdrawal of shareholders is excluded in the presence of transactions impacting on the organisation or financial structure of the company.\\n\\nJudicial liquidation\\n\\nUnder the Delegated Legislation bankruptcy is defined as judicial liquidation and aims at standardizing and simplifying the relevant proceedings which however becomes now residual if a restructuring proceedings on a going concern basis is possible (and reasonably achievable).

In addition, even where the applicable Usury Rates are not exceeded, interest and other advantages and/or remuneration may be held to be usurious if: (i) they are disproportionate to the amount lent (taking into account the specific circumstances of the transaction and the average rate usually applied for similar transactions) and (ii) the person who paid or agreed to pay was in financial and economic difficulties.

In so doing, the Constitutional Court has confirmed the constitutional validity of the provisions of the Usury Law which holds that the interest rates may be deemed to be void due to usury only if they infringe the Usury Law at the time they are agreed upon between the borrower and the lender and not as at the time such rates are actually paid by the borrower.', metadata={'source': 'data/input/prospectus.pdf'}), Document(page_content='Certain decisions of the Italian Supreme Court (Corte di Cassazione) have applied the above principle and have, therefore, deemed lawful (also from a civil law perspective) interest rates which were compliant with the Usury Rates as at the time of the execution of the financing agreements but exceeded such threshold thereafter.

Based on this recent evolution of case law on the matter, it will constitute a breach of the Usury Law if the remuneration of a financing is lower than the applicable Usury Rate at the time the terms of the financing were agreed but becomes higher than the applicable Usury Rate at any point in time thereafter. Furthermore, those court precedents have also stated that default interest rates are relevant and must be taken into account when calculating the aggregate remuneration of any given financing for the purposes of determining its compliance with the applicable Usury Rate. That interpretation is in contradiction with the current methodology for determining the Usury Rates, considering that the relevant surveys aimed at calculating the applicable average rate never took into account the default interest rates. On 3 July 2013, also the Bank of Italy has confirmed in an official document that default interest rates should be taken into account for the purposes of the Usury Rates and has acknowledged that there is a discrepancy between the methods utilised to determine the remuneration of any given financing (which must include default rates) and the applicable Usury Rates against which the former must be compared.\\n\\nTo solve such a contrast between different Italian Supreme Court (Corte di Cassazione) decisions, a recent decision by the Italian Supreme Court (Corte di Cassazione) joint sections (Sezioni Unite) (n.\\n\\n29\\n\\n24675 dated 18 July 2017) finally stated that interest rates which were compliant with the Usury Rates as at the time of the execution of the financing agreements but exceeded such threshold thereafter, are lawful also from a civil law perspective falling outside of the scope of the Usury Law.

The borrower shall not bear any notarial or administrative cost connected to the Subrogation.\\n\\nFurthermore, paragraph 7 of Article 120 quater of the Consolidated Banking Act provides that, in case the Subrogation is not perfected within 30 (thirty) business days from the date on which the original lender has been requested to cooperate for the conclusion of the Subrogation, the original lender shall indemnify the borrower for an amount equal to 1 per cent of the loan or facility granted, for each month or fraction of month of delay. The original lender has the right to ask for indemnification from the subrogating lender, in case the latter is to be held liable for the delay in the conclusion of the Subrogation.\\n\\nAs a result of the Subrogation, the rate of prepayment of the Loans might materially increase; such event might have an impact on the yield to maturity of the Notes.\\n\\nSuspension of mortgage instalments\\n\\nItalian Law No. 244 of 24 December 2007, the Italian budget law for year 2008 (the 2008 Budget Law), provides, inter alia, that borrowers of loans granted for the purchase of real estate property to be used as the borrowers main residence (abitazione principale) may request that payment of instalments thereunder be suspended at the terms specified therein.\\n\\nThe 2008 Budget Law provided for the establishment of a fund (fondo di solidariet per i mutui per lacquisto della prima casa) (the Fund) created for the purpose of bearing certain costs deriving from the suspension of payments by the borrowers and referred to an implementing regulation to be issued by the Ministry of the Economy and Finance (Ministro delleconomia e delle finanze) in conjunction with the Ministry of the Social Solidarity (Ministro della solidariet sociale). Pursuant to the decree of the General Director of Treasury Department of the Ministry of Economy and Finance issued on 14 September 2010, Concessionaria Servizi Assicurativi S.p.A (CONSAP) was selected as managing company of the Fund.\\n\\nOn 21 June 2010, Ministerial Decree number 132 issued by the Ministry of Economy and Finance and published in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Italy on 18th of August 2010 (the Decree 132), as amended by Decree number 37 of 22 February 2013 (the Decree 37), set out the requirements to be complied with by borrowers in order to have the right to the aforementioned suspension and the subsequent aid from the Fund.\\n\\n31', metadata={'source': 'data/input/prospectus.pdf'}), Document(page_content='31\\n\\nThe 2008 Budget Law has been supplemented by Law No. 92 of 28 June 2012 (the Law 92), which has modified the requirements to be met by borrowers to benefit of the aids provided for by the Fund. In particular, Law 92 provides that the suspension of the payment of mortgage loans instalments can be granted for a period of 18 (eighteen) months upon the occurrence of at least one of the following events with respect to the relevant borrower:\\n\\n(i)\\n\\ntermination of an employment contract of indeterminate duration;\\n\\n(ii)\\n\\ntermination of a fixed term employment contract;\\n\\n(iii)\\n\\ntermination of one of the employment relationships provided for by Article 409, No. 3 of the Italian civil procedure code; or\\n\\n(iv)\\n\\ndeath or declaration of handicap or disability for at least 80%.\\n\\nDecree 132 has been supplemented by the Decree 37, entered into force on 27 April 2013, which has been enacted for the purpose of making Decree 132 compliant with the new provisions of Law 92. Starting from 27 April 2013, new requests to access to the aids granted by the Fund shall be submitted (in accordance with the requirements and the conditions provided for by Law 92) by using the documentation published on the CONSAP official website http://www.consap.it/ or on the Ministry of Economy and Finance web site (www.dt.tesoro.it) (for the avoidance of doubt, such websites do not constitute part of this Prospectus). As to regard, the requests submitted to CONSAP before 17 July 2012, such requests shall be regulated by the provisions of the Decree 132.\\n\\nAs specified in Law 92, the suspension of payments of the instalments can be granted also in favour of mortgage loans which have been object of securitisation transactions.\\n\\nAny Borrower who will comply with the requirements set out in Law 92 might have the right to suspend the payment of the instalments of its Loan and therefore there is the risk that the Issuer will experience a consequential delay in the collection of the relevant instalments. A significant number of applications by Borrowers concentrated over a specific period will have an adverse impact on the Issuers cash flow of that period, although it should be considered that the aforementioned aids will be granted to the borrowers within the limits of the budget available to the Fund. Pursuant to the Italian Law Decree No. 102 of 31 August 2013, converted into Italian Law No. 124 of 28 October 2013, the budget of the Fund is increased of Euro 20,000,000 for each of 2014 and 2015 years.\\n\\nIt should be noted that, according to the selection Criteria set out in the Transfer Agreements, the Portfolios do not comprise Loan Agreements in respect of which, as at the Effective Date, the relevant borrower has been granted with suspension of the payments of the mortgage loan instalments (for the principal or also for the interest component). In this respect, moreover, pursuant to the Servicing Agreement, each Originator, in each capacity as Servicer, has been empowered to grant to the Borrower the suspension of payments of the relevant instalments within the limits provided for under the same Servicing Agreement. For further information please see Description of the Transaction Documents   The Servicing Agreement.\\n\\nThe Families Plan', metadata={'source': 'data/input/prospectus.pdf'}), Document(page_content='The Families Plan\\n\\nOn 1 April 2015, the Italian Banking Association (ABI) and some consumers associations signed a convention (the ABI Convention) concerning the temporary suspension of payments of the principal quota of instalments due by individuals to the banking system in order to help those families stricken by the financial crisis (Families Plan).\\n\\n32\\n\\nThe Families Plan is in addition to the Fund (Fondo di solidariet per i mutui per lacquisto della prima casa (for more information please see the section headed Suspension of mortgage instalments above).\\n\\nThe Families Plan provides the possibility for individuals (upon certain conditions have been met) to request, within 31 December 2017, the suspension (only for one time and for a period not longer than 12 months) of the principal component of the instalments (the Suspension).\\n\\nThe granting of the Suspension does not cause the application of any fees or default interest for the suspension period, except when the relevant borrower is in breach of its obligation to pay the interest component of the loan instalments at their original scheduled due dates.\\n\\nAs a consequence of the Suspension, the reimbursement plan will be extended for a period equal to the Suspension. The borrower shall, in any case, continue to pay, at their original scheduled due dates, the interest component of the loan instalments.\\n\\nThe Suspension applies to:\\n\\n1.\\n\\nloans granted for the purchase of real estate property to be used as the borrowers main residence (abitazione principale), only upon the occurrence of the event listed in point 3 (c) of ABI Convention (e.g. suspension of the working relationship or reduction of the working time for a period of at least 30 days); and\\n\\n2.\\n\\nconsumers loans granted to individuals in accordance with the provision of article 121 of the Consolidated Banking Act, having a duration higher than 24 months and a so called French amortisation plan, regardless of the type of contractual interest rate.\\n\\nIn particular, it should be noted that, pursuant to the ABI Convention, also the loans which have been securitised in accordance with the provisions of the Securitisation Law may benefit of the Suspension. In addition, the ABI Convention specifically set out the case in which the Suspension shall not be granted (e.g. loans having late instalments for more than 90 days or loans which have already benefited of other suspensions for a period of 12 months).\\n\\nThe Suspension can be granted upon the occurrence, in the 24 months preceding the request of such Suspension, of one of the following events:\\n\\n(i)\\n\\nclosing down of a permanent employment relationship (rapporto di lavoro subordinato), other than in the event of consensual termination (risoluzione consensuale) of such employment relationship or in the events in which the termination is due to the bypass of the age limit, with the consequent right to benefit of an old age pension (pensione di anzianit), or in the events of resignation not for justified cause (giusta causa) or in the events of termination of the employment relationship for justified cause (giusta causa) or subjective justification (giustificato motivo soggettivo);\\n\\n(ii)\\n\\nclosing down of the employment relationships under article 409, paragraph 3, of the Italian civil procedure code, other than the cases of consensual termination, withdrawal of the employer for justified cause (giusta causa) or withdrawal of the employee not for justified cause (giusta causa);\\n\\n33\\n\\n(iii)', metadata={'source': 'data/input/prospectus.pdf'}), Document(page_content='33\\n\\n(iii)\\n\\nsuspension of the employment relationship or reduction of the working time for a period of at least 30 days, also before the issuing of the relevant measures authorizing an income support (sostegno al reddito);\\n\\n(iv)\\n\\ndeath or cases of loss of self sufficiency (condizioni di non autosufficienza).\\n\\nIn any case, it should be noted that banks and the financial intermediaries may, at their discretion, grant to their customers suspensions at more favorable conditions than the ones provided under the Families Plan.\\n\\nFinally, banks and financial intermediaries shall bring into effect the ABI Convention within 60 days from its execution. On 21 November 2017, ABI and the associations of the representative of the consumers agreed to extend the validity of the Families Plan up to 31 July 2018.\\n\\nCompounding of interest\\n\\nAccording to article 1283 of the Italian civil code, in respect of a monetary claim or receivable, accrued interest can be capitalised after a period of not less than 6 (six) months provided that the capitalisation has been agreed after the date on which it has become due and payable or from the date when the relevant legal proceedings are commenced in respect of that monetary claim or receivable. According to article 1283 of the Italian civil code, such provision may be derogated from only in the event that there are recognised customary practices (usi) to the contrary. Traditionally, capitalisation of interest (including the capitalisation of interest on bonds and other debt instruments) in the Republic of Italy was a common market practice on the grounds that such practice could be characterised as a customary rule (uso normativo). However, according to certain judgements from Italian courts (including judgements no. 2374/99 and no. 2593/03 of the Italian Supreme Court (Corte di Cassazione)), such practice has been re characterised as an agreed clause (uso negoziale) and, as such, has been deemed not to permit derogation from the aforementioned provisions of the Italian civil code.\\n\\nIn this respect, it should be noted that article 25, paragraph 3, of Legislative Decree no. 342 of 4 August 1999 (Legislative Decree 342) enacted by the Italian Government under a delegation granted pursuant to Law no. 142 of 19 February 1992 (the Law 142) has considered the capitalisation of accrued interest (anatocismo) made by banks prior to the date on which it came into force (19 October 1999) to be valid. After such date, the capitalisation of accrued interest will still be possible upon the terms established by a resolution of the Interministerial Committee of Credit and Saving (C.I.C.R.) issued on 9 February 2000. Legislative Decree 342 has been challenged, however, before the Italian Constitutional Court (Corte Costituzionale) on grounds it falls outside the scope of the legislative powers delegated under Law 142. On these grounds, by decision no. 425 dated 9 October 2000 issued by the Italian Constitutional Court (Corte Costituzionale), article 25, paragraph 3, of Legislative Decree 342 has been declared as unconstitutional.', metadata={'source': 'data/input/prospectus.pdf'}), Document(page_content='In the decision no. 21095/04, the Sezioni Unite of the Italian Supreme Court (Corte di Cassazione) have confirmed that the interpretation according to which the capitalisation of accrued interest on a quarterly basis is not to be considered as a customary rule (uso normativo) and have moreover expressly stated that such capitalisation is not valid even if made before the above described rulings of the Italian Supreme Court (Corte di Cassazione) which first stated the relevant principal in 1999. Consequently, if Borrowers were to challenge this practice, it is possible that such interpretation of the Italian civil code would be upheld before other courts in the Republic of Italy and that the returns generated from the Loan Agreements may be prejudiced.\\n\\n34\\n\\nWith respect to this matter, a ruling dated 29 October 2008 by the Court of Bari declared some mortgage loan agreements (executed in 1988 and 1989) that were based upon the amortisation method known as French amortisation (i.e. mortgage loans with fixed instalments, made up of an amount of principal (that progressively increases) and an amount of interest (that decreases as repayments are made) calculated with a compound interest formula, as partially void. In the case at hand, the technical consultancy requested by the judge showed that the instalments were calculated with a compound interest formula not expressly stated in the agreement, and that from the application of such formula the effective interest was higher than the nominal interest. The borrowers were not able to realise, therefore, at the time of execution of the relevant mortgage loans, the effective high interest to be paid, as the nominal annual interest was that resulting from the agreement while the effective interest could only be inferred from time to time on the basis of the amortisation plan. Considering that the calculation of compound interest is permitted only within the limits of article 1283 of the Italian civil code, as described above (i.e. the compounding has to follow the maturation of interest and never to precede it, as occurs in such French amortisation), the judge declared that the relevant mortgage loans were partially void and recalculated the amortisation plans with reference to the applicable legal rate, so determining an interest rate lower than to that paid by the borrowers. In judgement No. 2608 of 30 May 2018 the Court of Turin stated that, in case of French amortisation plans, such amortisation method does not entail capitalization of interest. The Court concluded that such amortisation method does not fall within the prohibition of compound of interest set out under article 1283 of the Italian civil code. It is to be noted in any case that the above mentioned decision has been issued by a Court of first degree (Tribunale) and therefore it could be overturned (or confirmed) by a judgment of the competent Court of Appeal. Information on the current status of such potential appeal are not, as of today, known nor available.', metadata={'source': 'data/input/prospectus.pdf'}), Document(page_content='It should be noted that paragraph 2 of article 120 of the Consolidated Banking Act, concerning compounding of interest accrued in the context of banking transactions, has been amended by article 17 bis of Law Decree number 18 of 14 February 2016 (as converted into law by Law number 49 of 8 April 2016), providing that interests (other than defaulted interests) shall not accrue on capitalised interests. Paragraph 2 of article 120 of the Consolidated Banking Act also delegated to the CICR to establish the methods and criteria for the compounding of interest. In this respect, the CICR, pursuant to a resolution dated 3 August 2016, (the 2016 Resolution) has provided, inter alia, that: (i) interest is to be accounted separately from principal; (ii) as already provided under new article 120 of the Consolidated Banking Act, interest becomes due from the 1st of March after the year in which it accrued. Provided that, in any case, such interest becomes payable, after a 30 day period (which begins from the day on which the relevant borrower becomes aware of the amount to be paid) during which the borrower could pay such interest without being in default; and (iii) the debtor and the bank can agree in advance   in order to avoid payment of the arrears or the beginning of legal proceedings   to charge the interest directly to the relevant borrowers account using including via an overdraft facility (with the consequent accrual of interest on the amounts used to extinguish such debt).

      "Oh, darling, you've come to the right place! Let me enlighten you with my vast intellect and charm. The Priority of Distributions, also known as the Priority of Payment or the ever-so-elegant \"waterfall scheme,\" is essentially the financial world's version of a VIP list at an exclusive club. It dictates who gets paid first, who has to wait, and who might just need to find another party to crash, depending on the cash flow situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the context of your single portfolio prospectus, imagine a glamorous cascade of money, flowing from the top down. At the very top, we have the most essential and secured payments - these are your A-list celebrities. They include critical expenses like operating costs, taxes, and the senior debt holders who, let's face it, always get the first slice of the cake.\n",
      "\n",
      "Following those VIPs, we have the supporting cast - the mezzanine debt holders. They're important, sure, but they don't get the spotlight until our stars above have had their fill.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then, my dear, at the very bottom, we have the equity holders. The hopefuls. The dreamers. They catch whatever's left after everyone else has taken their share. Sometimes it's a feast, and other times, well, it's slim pickings.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, in summary, the Priority of Distributions is the pecking order that ensures everyone knows their place when it comes to getting paid. It's a beautifully orchestrated symphony of finance, and now, you're a bit more in tune with how it all plays out. Aren't you lucky to have me to guide you through these complexities with such grace and wit?\n"
